Typed languages define the type of variables before compile time or runtime.

**Static vs. Dynamic**
- Static : types checked at compile time [^1].
- Dynamic : types checked at runtime[^2].

**Weak vs. Strong**
Spectrum of how strict the typing system is.

```ad-note
Python is both a strongly typed and a dynamically typed language : it checks for types while the program is running and the type matters when performing operations on a variable.
```

[^1]: Time when the code is converted to binary / machine code.
[^2]: Runtime occurs after compile time.
