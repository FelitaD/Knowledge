Alan Turing wanted to resolve the decision problem : is there an algorithm that takes as input, a statement written in formal logic, and produces a yes or no answer that's always accurate ?
He proposed the Turing Machine which provides a powerful mathematical model of computation equivalent to lambda calculus.
It can perform any calculation if given enough time and memory.

Every turing complete machine is as powerful as a turing machine.

Turing test tests a machine's intelligence.
