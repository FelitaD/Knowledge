In multitasking computer operating systems, a daemon is a computer program that runs as a **background process**, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user.

Traditionally, the process names of a daemon end with the letter _d_, for clarification that the process is in fact a daemon, and for differentiation between a daemon and a normal computer program. For example, [syslogd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslogd "Syslogd") is a daemon that implements system logging facility, and sshd is a daemon that serves incoming [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell "Secure Shell") connections.
