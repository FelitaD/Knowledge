Layers and chemical reactions + zoom of the schema of integrated circuit -> on silicon.
Moore's law is more of a tendency that the number of transistors doubles on same amount of space.
1 billion of transistors in 1 Integrated Circuit in 2010.
Limit to Morre's law is quantum tunneling : when electrons can jump the gap of few atoms.
