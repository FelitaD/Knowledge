Data models provide a blueprint for designing a new database or reengineering a legacy application.
# Types of data models

- Conceptual : what the system contains
- Logical : how implemented (general rules and data structures)
- Physical : how implemented in the DBMS

> [[Data engineering]] go straight to the physical model -> actual implementation of the database.

# Data modeling tools

Better to control version the diagram instead of using a line diagraming tool like draw io.

- [[UML]] diagrams vs [[Diagram as code - C4 model with Structurizr]]:
	- [Mermaid vs PlantUML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPh9_Cx4yZY&ab_channel=ArjanCodes) : 
		- Mermaid arrows are very confusing and liberty of diagrams limited
		- PlantUML is very old, needs server for rendering image, but has a lot of diagrams
	- Solution : [[Diagram as code - C4 model with Structurizr]]

- [[ER model]] diagrams :
	- [DBdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home)
