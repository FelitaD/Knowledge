Analytics phase. Central and most important one.

Done in 2 main ways :
- [[Stream processing]] 
Uses data from the connect phase and fed into analytics.
Analyses live data generating fast results.
- [[Batch processing]]
Take big chunks of data from the big data storage.

Analytics is not a one way process where only takes data in.
Can write the analysed data back into storage.
Combining previous analytics with raw data can provide new insights.

A lot of analytics tools exist : [[MapReduce]], AWS Elastic MapReduce, Apache [[Spark]], AWS [[Lambda]].
