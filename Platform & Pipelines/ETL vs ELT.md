| Maturity                      | The process is used for over two decades. It is well documented and best practices easily available.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Relatively new concept and complex to implement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Implementation                | At an early stage, easier to implement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | To implement ELT process organization should have deep knowledge of tools and expert skills.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Transformation how            | In the ETL process, data transformation is performed in a staging area outside of the data warehouse and the entire data must be transformed before loading. As a result, transforming larger data sets can take a long time up front but analysis can take place immediately once the ETL process is complete. | In the ELT process, data transformation is performed on an as-needed basis in the target system itself. As a result, the transformation step takes little time but can slow down the querying and analysis processes if there is not sufficient processing power. |
| Transformation where          | Transformations are done in ETL server/staging area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Transformations are performed in the target system                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Time-transformation           | ETL process needs to wait for transformation to complete. As data size grows, transformation time increases.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | In ELT process, speed is never dependant on the size of the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Time-load                     | Data first loaded into staging and later loaded into target system. Time intensive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Data loaded into target system only once. Faster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Time-maintenance              | It needs highs maintenance as you need to select data to load and transform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Low maintenance as data is always available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Maintenance/Ease of Use       | ETL processes that involve an on-premise server require frequent maintenance by IT given their fixed tables, fixed timelines and the requirement to repeatedly select data to load and transform. Newer automated, cloud-based ETL solutions require little maintenance.                                        | The ELT process typically requires low maintenance given that all data is always available and the transformation process is usually automated and cloud-based                                                                                                    |
| Loading                       | The ETL loading step requires data to be loaded into a staging area before being loaded into the target system. This multi-step process takes longer than the ELT process                                                                                                                                       | In ELT, the full data set is loaded directly into the target system. Since there is only one step, and it only happens one time, loading in the ELT process is faster than ETL.                                                                                   |
| Size / type of dataset        | ETL is most appropriate for processing smaller, relational data sets which require complex transformations and have been predetermined as being relevant to the analysis goals                                                                                                                                  | Any size or type of data, both structured and unstructured. Since the entire data set is loaded, analysts can choose at any time which data to transform and use for analysis                                                                                     |

| Calculations                  | Overwrites existing column or Need to append the dataset and push to the target platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Easily add the calculated column to the existing table.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Compliance                    | ETL is better suited for compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA standards given that users can omit any sensitive data prior to loading in the target system.                                                                                                                                                    | ELT carries more risk of exposing private data and not complying with GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA standards given that all data is loaded into the target system.                                                                                                       |
| Cost                          | ETL can be cost-prohibitive for many small and medium businesses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | ELT benefits from a robust ecosystem of cloud-based platforms which offer much lower costs and a variety of plan options to store and process data.                                                                                                               |
| Cost                          | High costs for small and medium businesses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Low entry costs using online Software as a Service Platforms.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Hardware                      | The traditional, on-premises ETL process requires expensive hardware. Newer, cloud-based ETL solutions do not require hardware.                                                                                                                                                                                 | Given that the ELT process is inherently cloud-based, no additional hardware is required.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Hardware                      | Most tools have unique hardware requirements that are expensive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Being Saas hardware cost is not an issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
