# First Step: Inspect

- **Explicitly state the input**
What are the inputs of the function ?
What are their types ?
What does each input represent ?

`Input: n(arr<str>), k(int)`

- **Clarify the desired output**
What output is expected ?
What's its type ?

`Output: bool`

- **Construct a simple example**

- **Rewrite the constraints**

- **Make assumptions of the edge cases**

# Second Step: Strategize

- **Brainstorm a simple solution**
Draw the solution by hand
