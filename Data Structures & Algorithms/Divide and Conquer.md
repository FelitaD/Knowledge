Divide and Conquer algorithm solves (certain kind of) problem — like our sorting problem — in the following steps:

1. Divide step: Divide the large, original problem into smaller sub-problems and recursively solve the smaller sub-problems,
2. Conquer step: Combine the results of the smaller sub-problems to produce the result of the larger, original problem.
