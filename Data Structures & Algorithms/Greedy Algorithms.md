Build a solution by choosing what looks best at each step (?)


Examples when it gives the optimal solution:

- Give 67 cents -> 50 + 10 + 5 + 2
Always choosing the solution that covers the biggest portion of the problem.
- Trying to fit as many overlapping meetings in a conference room -> schedule those that end the earliest 

Examples where it doesn't:

- Filling a jar with rocks -> beginning by the biggest doesn't produce best result
