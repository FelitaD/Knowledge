Basic operators of relational algebra.

|    Operator     |         |       |
| ------- | ------- | ----- |
| Select  | rows    | sigma |
| Project | columns | pi    |
| Cartesian product        | glues together tables        | x      |

Join :
- **natural join**, enforce equality on columns with same name by eliminating one copy;
- **theta join** operator, abbreviates join with condition -> the one most commonly refered to.
